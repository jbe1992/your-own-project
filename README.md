# Welcome to Title to be defined!

## Project Goals
Do a database to store all the current jobs offers in Spain about Web Development. Then I will create a jupyter notebook to analyze the data.

How to get the data:

 APIS:
  - Indeed: http://opensource.indeedeng.io/api-documentation/docs/job-search/
  - Infojobs: https://developer.infojobs.net/test-console/execute.xhtml
  - Linkedin: https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/guide/v2/jobs/recommended-jobs (You can only retrieve recommended jobs)
  
 Questions to answer:
  - Descriptive stats of salary. (Maybe with a scatter plot, not sure yet)
  - What skills do you need to get a job as a Web Developer? (Word cloud graph here)
  - In which city do you have more offers? (Ploting a map here).
