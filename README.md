# Welcome to from job_search import data_analytics!

## Project Goals
Do a database to store all the current jobs offers in Spain about Web Development, Front-End, Back-End. Then I will create a jupyter notebook to analyze the data.

Repo content:
/csvs: information imported to do the analysis.
/graficos: plots generated in the paper in .png extension.
/infojob json: json files extracted from Infojobs API and used to do the project.
Project.ipynb: Main paper with the code done.

How to get the data:

 **APIS:**
  - **Indeed:** http://opensource.indeedeng.io/api-documentation/docs/job-search/
  - **Infojobs:** https://developer.infojobs.net/test-console/execute.xhtml
  - **Linkedin:** https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/guide/v2/jobs/recommended-jobs (You can only retrieve recommended jobs)
  
 Questions to answer:
  - Descriptive stats of salary. (Confidence interval)
  - What skills do you need to get a job as a Web Developer? (Word cloud graph here)
  - In which city do you have more offers? (Ploting a map here).
